# CRISI-Style Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) Review – Mock Demonstration

## Executive Summary

A synthetic CRISI-style rail safety project was evaluated over a 20-year analysis period using a 7% real discount rate consistent with OMB Circular A-94 guidance.  

The applicant reported a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of **2.15 at 7%**.

Reviewer adjustments included moderating unsupported traffic growth assumptions and aligning valuation inputs with current federal guidance. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted at a 3% real discount rate.

Revised results:

- **BCR (7%)**: 2.02  
- **BCR (3%)**: 2.65  

The project remains economically justified under both discount rates, though results are sensitive to projected traffic growth.
